# Scratch
lol, I think it's funny to use github but whatevs. 

Everything in the scratch repo is AI husbanded content that I have espoused with the use of chatGPT.

So paymentgateway is a thought experiment in making use of a DERO Smart and the various APIs that are out there to make a credit card to DERO transaction possible. 

TWERO on the other hand is a funny idea that people would want to brag about their dero txs. Ironic, actually.
